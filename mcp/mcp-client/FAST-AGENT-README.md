**`fast-agent`** enables you to create and interact with sophisticated Agents and Workflows in minutes. It is the first framework with complete, end-to-end tested MCP Feature support including Sampling. Both Anthropic (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and OpenAI models (gpt-4o/gpt-4.1 family, o1/o3 family) are supported.

The simple declarative syntax lets you concentrate on composing your Prompts and MCP Servers to [build effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents).

`fast-agent` is multi-modal, supporting Images and PDFs for both Anthropic and OpenAI endpoints via Prompts, Resources and MCP Tool Call results. The inclusion of passthrough and playback LLMs enable rapid development and test of Python glue-code for your applications.

### Agent Application Development

Prompts and configurations that define your Agent Applications are stored in simple files, with minimal boilerplate, enabling simple management and version control.

Chat with individual Agents and Components before, during and after workflow execution to tune and diagnose your application. Agents can request human input to get additional context for task completion.

Simple model selection makes testing Model <-> MCP Server interaction painless. You can read more about the motivation behind this project [here](https://llmindset.co.uk/resources/fast-agent/)
